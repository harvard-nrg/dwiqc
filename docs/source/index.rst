DWIQC is a diffusion MRI quality control pipeline built on the `Prequal` and `QSIPREP` software packages. Working closely with neuroimaging experts, we designed an ergonomic user interface for the `_XNAT` informatics and data management platform that allows users to quickly assess image quality and use those insights to get ahead of issues within the data acquisition workflow.
